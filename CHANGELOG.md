# Changelog

This file is hand-maintained. The `Unreleased` section is a running summary of what
exists on `main` since the last tag; each release moves it under a version heading.
The changelog goreleaser attaches to a GitHub release itself is generated separately
from conventional-commit prefixes in the git log, and is not a replacement for this.

## Unreleased

Sirdar as it stands today, before the first tagged release:

A command-line harness (`sirdar init`, `doctor`, `triage`, `rca`, `resume`, `runs`,
`register`, `serve`) that reads an engineering-support ticket from a tracker and a
helpdesk, hands it to a coding agent inside a read-only workspace, and writes a
Triage Note recording the agent's root-cause hypothesis for a human to review. Once a
human has made and merged the actual fix, `sirdar rca` writes the RCA and Resolution
notes that record what changed and why — Sirdar never opens a PR or writes to a
tracker or helpdesk itself.

Three ways to drive a run: `provider: claude` and `provider: codex` spawn the Claude
Code or Codex CLI already installed and signed in, so a run counts against the plan
already being paid for; `provider: openai` runs Sirdar's own agent loop against any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenRouter, Groq, Together, DeepSeek, Moonshot, Zhipu, or
a local Ollama/vLLM/llama.cpp), billed per token against a budget set in config.

Built-in tracker adapters for Jira Cloud, Jira Data Center, Linear, Azure DevOps, and
Rally; built-in helpdesk adapters for Zoho Desk (with OAuth refresh), Zendesk, and
Freshdesk. Anything else — an internal tracker, a different helpdesk — is a separate
executable speaking a small line-delimited JSON protocol over stdin/stdout, so its
credentials and vendor-specific code never touch Sirdar's core.

A Wails v2 desktop app under `desktop/` sharing the same React frontend that
`sirdar serve` serves over HTTP; the desktop build talks to the core in-process
through a bound Go bridge instead of over the network, and observes run directories
rather than hooking the runner directly.

The read-only guarantee (Sirdar reads a workspace and runs allow-listed commands in
it, but never edits or writes) is enforced per provider: `--disallowedTools` and a
command-pattern policy for Claude, `sandbox: read-only` for Codex, and for
`provider: openai` the tool set itself plus command-pattern matching and an MCP
write-verb heuristic.

Release packaging: darwin/linux/windows binaries on amd64/arm64 via goreleaser, deb/rpm
packages, a Homebrew tap, and desktop app zips for all three platforms — see
`docs/release.md`.
